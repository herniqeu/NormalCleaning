# NormalCleaning
This repository contains the code and data used to conduct a benchmark on data cleaning methods using normal distribution. The goal of this project was to compare the performance of different data cleaning methods, namely mean, median, and mode, in handling normal distributions.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this benchmark consists of a set of values generated from a normal distribution. The dataset contains 1201 rows and 4 columns, with each row representing a different sample size and each column containing different statistical measures: mean, median, mode, and normal distribution.

Data Cleaning Methods
In this project, we compared the performance of three different data cleaning methods on the normal distribution dataset. The methods used were:

Mean
Median
Mode
We used these methods to clean the dataset and then compared the results to determine which method performed the best.

## **Results**
The results of the benchmarking showed that the mean performed the best on the dataset, followed closely by the median. The mode performed the worst, which indicates that it may not be the best method for handling normal distributions.
